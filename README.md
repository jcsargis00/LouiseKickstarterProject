# Analyzing Data to Predict Success or Failure of Kickstarter Fundraising Campaigns with a particular interest in Theater and Plays

## Overview of Project and Purpose for Data Analysis
Louise's play *Fever* Kickstarter fundraising campaign was close to successful, but not in the short amount of time she allowed.  The purpose of this analysis is to determine what variables were in common in successful, failed, live and cancelled campaigns.  The data set analyzed is comprised of Kickstarter data from 4100 campaigns launched between May 2009 and March 2017.  The purpose of the study is to investigate campaign outcomes based on launch date and funding goal amounts.

## Analysis and Challenges
Additional visualization of the data using summary tables, charts and graphs will allow Louise  to see the outcomes of all the categories.  Although looking at the theater data as a category is insiinsightful, additional detailed data will make the analysis more thorough.  By creating pivot charts and pivot tables, bar charts and line graphs can be generated from the data to show links and trends. These types of graphic visualizations make it easier to spot a trend than in a table (particularly if the table is large).   With this dataset, I was able to look at campaigns in the US (3038) or in Great Britain (604), where theater campaigns are most successful, since these are the two areas Louise is interested in launching her play.  The length of campaigns, the time of year of the campaign launch, as well as, the goal funding amounts versus success or failure are also of interest.  Finally, I applied a filter on the data to hone in on theater and plays campaigns specifically.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
